- Modified `invoiceRouter.createFromOrder` to use the actual `defaultVatRatePercent` from `InventoryItem` for each line item, instead of the placeholder `25.5`. Added a `TODO` for company-level VAT fallback.
- Attempted to fix build errors in `InvoiceListContent.tsx` (related to `keepPreviousData` and Prisma type imports) and `EditInventoryItemPage.tsx` (related to `isPending` vs `isLoading`). Build is currently failing due to new errors introduced during these fixes and persistent issues in `InvoiceListContent.tsx` and `httpBatchStreamLink` import in `src/lib/trpc/react.tsx`.
- Add `defaultVatRatePercent` to `InventoryItem` model and regenerate Prisma client.
- Correct `OrderStatus.invoiced` to `OrderStatus.INVOICED`.
- Ensure Zod schemas are correctly inferred as types using `z.infer<typeof ...>` in `invoice.ts`.

- Addressed multiple linter errors across various files including `InvoiceListContent.tsx`, `OrderStatusUpdateModal.tsx`, and `inventory/page.tsx`.
- Fixed React Hook order error in `InvoiceListContent.tsx`.
- Addressed settings page issues: `settings.get` now returns `null` if no settings exist, `settings.update` only updates (no creation), and `SettingsPage.tsx` handles the null case by showing a message and disabling save.
- Resolved build errors related to missing `sku` property in `orders/add/page.tsx` and `EditOrderFormLoader.tsx`.
- Fixed build error in `layout.tsx` by passing the `cookies` prop to `TRPCReactProvider`.
- Ensured `economicOrderQuantity` was correctly identified as not being part of the `InventoryItem` model, so its removal from a data mapping was not a feature regression.
- Clarified that invoicing is not strictly tied to 'shipped' order status in the backend, aligning with user request.
- Reviewed code changes for over-complication and performance, concluding that changes were generally for simplification, correctness, and leveraging existing performance patterns (React Query caching, server-side operations).

- Enhanced Inventory List: Added category badges, category filter, global search, server-side sorting/pagination, and inline editable quantity on hand with confirmation.
- Enhanced Dashboard: Replenishment alerts table now shows actual data including lead time, vendor SKU, and vendor item name.
- Replaced recursive Decimal-to-string conversion in `invoice.get` tRPC router with an explicit, non-recursive transformation (`transformInvoiceData`) to robustly fix SuperJSON serialization errors (500 errors and "Detected property constructor" warnings).
- Implemented UI enhancements on Invoice Detail page: separated billing/shipping addresses, improved item table padding, added notes section, restyled action buttons, and grouped some into a dropdown.
- Updated breadcrumbs to display invoice/order numbers instead of IDs using a new BreadcrumbContext.
- Fixed 'Maximum update depth exceeded' error by memoizing context functions in `BreadcrumbContext` with `useCallback`.
