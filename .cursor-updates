# .cursor-updates

- Temporarily remove OrderForm and Invoices page to resolve build errors
- Refactored `OrdersPage` to wrap the part using `useSearchParams` in `<Suspense>`, fixing the build error.
- Implemented initial Invoice list page (`/invoices`) with tRPC backend, Shadcn DataTable, filtering, sorting, and pagination.
