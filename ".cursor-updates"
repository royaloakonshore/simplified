## 2025-02-01: Language Switcher Requirements & System Enhancement Analysis

**Goal:** Analyze new requirements for multi-language support, credit note partial functionality, and PDF generation strategy based on Midday.ai insights.

**Summary:**
Comprehensive analysis of new system requirements including language switcher (FI, SE, EN), enhanced credit note system for partial credits, and advanced PDF generation architecture inspired by Midday.ai's background job approach.

**üîç ANALYSIS FINDINGS:**

**‚úÖ LANGUAGE SWITCHER REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Scope Identified**: FI (Finnish), SE (Swedish), EN (English) support in user settings
- **Implementation Areas**: UI localization, customer language preference, document templates, email notifications
- **Architecture**: i18n framework with translation files and language context provider
- **Business Impact**: Critical for Finnish/Swedish market penetration

**‚ùå CREDIT NOTE LIMITATION DISCOVERED:**
- **Current Issue**: Only full credit notes supported (entire invoice negation)
- **Code Location**: `createCreditNote` function in `invoice.actions.ts` lines 484-485 negates ALL quantities
- **Required Enhancement**: Partial credit note functionality with item/quantity selection
- **Business Need**: Allow selective crediting of specific line items and quantities

**üöÄ PDF GENERATION STRATEGY REFINEMENT:**
- **Midday Insights**: Background job architecture using Trigger.dev for async PDF generation
- **Current Status**: Placeholder implementations exist across orders, invoices, BOMs
- **Required Enhancement**: Implement async PDF generation with Inngest, progress indicators, and cloud storage
- **Architecture**: Queue management, status tracking, and template system

**üìä EXCEL IMPORT/EXPORT STATUS:**
- **Current Implementation**: ‚úÖ Basic replenishment Excel export exists (`replenishment.ts` line 230)
- **Required Enhancement**: Full inventory CRUD via Excel import with validation framework
- **Template System**: Downloadable Excel templates with comprehensive validation

**üìã DOCUMENTATION UPDATES:**
- **‚úÖ Updated**: `docs/current-roadmap.md` with new priorities and implementation timeline
- **‚úÖ Updated**: `docs/00-product-requirements.md` with revised completion status (80% vs 99%) and new requirements
- **‚úÖ Updated**: `docs/next-steps-guide.md` with clarification questions and technical implementation notes

**ü§î CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS IDENTIFIED:**
1. **Language Switcher Scope**: UI only vs full document/email localization?
2. **Customer Language Preference**: Should customers have stored language preference for documents?
3. **Credit Note Business Rules**: Restrictions on partial credit amounts or timing?
4. **PDF Generation Priority**: Which document types need PDF generation first?

**üìà REVISED COMPLETION STATUS:**
- **Previous**: 99% completion claimed
- **Realistic Assessment**: 80% completion (core workflows complete, major features identified)
- **Remaining Work**: Language support, partial credit notes, professional PDF generation, advanced Excel operations

**‚è∞ DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES:**
- Language Foundation: 6 hours
- Enhanced Credit Notes: 6 hours  
- Background PDF Generation: 8 hours
- Advanced Excel Operations: 8 hours
- **Total**: 28 hours for complete feature set

**üéØ NEXT ACTIONS:**
- Await user clarification on language switcher scope and business requirements
- Plan technical implementation based on user feedback
- Prioritize development phases based on business impact
