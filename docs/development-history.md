## ðŸš¨ **Critical Fixes & Resolutions**

### **React Hook Form Type Constraints (January 27)**
- **Issue**: Complex type conflicts in `InventoryItemForm.tsx`
- **Solution**: Explicit type assertion `as UseFormReturn<InventoryItemFormValues>`
- **Result**: Removed `@ts-nocheck` workarounds, restored proper TypeScript typing

### **OrderStatus Enum Standardization (January 27)**
- **Issue**: Prisma client regeneration changed enum values
- **Solution**: Updated all references from `INVOICED` to `invoiced` (lowercase)
- **Files**: `OrderDetail.tsx`, `OrderStatusUpdateModal.tsx`, `invoice.ts` router

### **Decimal Object Runtime Errors (January 30)**
- **Issue**: Decimal serialization causing runtime crashes in production workflows
- **Solution**: Safe conversion patterns `typeof decimalField === 'object' && decimalField !== null`
- **Impact**: Stable invoice creation, BOM calculations, and production workflows

### **Navigation Link Errors (January 30)**
- **Issue**: Settings navigation throwing Link component errors
- **Solution**: Updated Link components to Next.js App Router patterns
- **Result**: Smooth navigation throughout application

### **Production Kanban UX Issues (January 31)**
- **Issue**: Overly sensitive drag behavior, non-functional buttons
- **Solution**: Dedicated drag handles, proper event handling, improved sensitivity controls
- **Result**: Reliable drag-and-drop with intuitive user experience
