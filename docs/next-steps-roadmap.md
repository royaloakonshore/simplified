# Next Steps Roadmap - Simplified ERP System

## ðŸ“Š **Current Status Summary**

### âœ… **Recently Completed:**
- Fixed TypeScript and build errors across the codebase
- Updated PageBanner component with Fluid_7.jpeg background
- Changed "Manufactured Good" to "Manufactured" in pill tags
- Fixed layout width jumping issues by removing container constraints
- Added critical database indexes for performance optimization
- Successfully deployed performance indexes migration

### ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Priority Queue**

---

## **ðŸ”´ WEEK 1: Core Feature Enhancements (HIGH IMPACT)**

### **Day 1-2: Replenishment Module Creation**
**Priority: CRITICAL** 
- **Create dedicated Replenishment page**: `/inventory/replenishment` for raw material management
- **Implement critical alerts table**: Top section showing most urgent reorder needs
- **Add bulk edit capabilities**: Multi-select for `leadTimeDays` and `reorderLevel` updates
- **Add InventoryCategory column**: Display with pill tags and filtering in main inventory
- **Estimated impact**: Major usability improvement for replenishment workflows

### **Day 3-4: Customer Module Action Dropdown**
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Replace "Edit" button** with dropdown menu in CustomerTable
- **Add actions**: "Create Invoice", "Create Quotation", "Create Work Order", "Edit Customer"
- **Estimated impact**: Streamlined workflow for customer management

### **Day 5: Initial Performance Optimizations**
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Optimize inventory list query**: Reduce over-fetching for list views
- **Configure React Query caching**: Implement stale-while-revalidate patterns
- **Add skeleton loading states**: Immediate perceived performance boost

---

## **ðŸŸ¡ WEEK 2: Advanced Table Features & Performance**

### **Day 1-3: Advanced Table Enhancements**
- **Inventory Table**: Implement search, filtering, pagination similar to CustomerTable
- **Add sorting capabilities**: Multi-column sorting with visual indicators
- **Implement bulk actions**: Multi-select checkboxes for bulk operations
- **Virtual scrolling**: For inventories with 500+ items

### **Day 4-5: Query & Caching Optimization**
- **Compound queries**: Create efficient `listWithCategories` endpoints
- **Background prefetching**: Implement smart prefetching based on user patterns
- **Search optimization**: Client-side filtering for small datasets, server-side for large

---

## **ðŸŸ¢ WEEK 3-4: User Experience & Advanced Features**

### **Customer Detail Enhancement**
- **Create Customer detail page**: Order/invoice history with pagination
- **Total net revenue display**: Calculated from invoice history
- **Quick action buttons**: Fast access to create new orders/invoices

### **Order & Invoice Module Improvements**
- **Searchable select dropdowns**: For Item and Customer selection in forms
- **Enhanced form UX**: Auto-complete, validation, and error handling
- **Bulk invoice generation**: From selected orders

### **Code Splitting & Bundle Optimization**
- **Lazy load heavy components**: BOM forms, PDF viewers, export dialogs
- **Dynamic imports**: Load expensive libraries on demand
- **Bundle analysis**: Identify and optimize large dependencies

---

## **ðŸ“ˆ Performance Optimization Implementation Plan**

2. **Fix InventoryItemForm.tsx** - Remove @ts-nocheck, proper TypeScript
3. **Enhance Inventory table** - New columns, conditional UI, category pills
4. **Customer action dropdown** - Streamline workflow

### **ðŸŸ¡ High Impact (Next Week)**
1. **Advanced table features** - Search, filter, sort, bulk actions
2. **Progressive loading** - Better perceived performance
3. **Code splitting** - Faster bundle loading
4. **Customer detail page** - Complete customer management flow

### **ðŸŸ¢ Enhancement (Following Weeks)**
1. **Real-time features** - Live inventory updates
2. **Advanced analytics** - Dashboard improvements
3. **Mobile optimization** - Responsive design enhancements
4. **Export/Import** - Bulk data operations

## **ðŸ“Š Success Metrics & Goals**

### **Performance Targets:**
- **Initial page load**: < 2 seconds (currently ~3-4s)
- **Navigation between pages**: < 500ms (currently ~1-2s)
- **Search results**: < 300ms (currently ~800ms-1.5s)
- **Table filtering**: < 200ms (currently ~500ms-1s)

### **User Experience Goals:**
