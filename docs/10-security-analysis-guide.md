## ðŸ“‹ **Security Analysis Checklist**

### **1. Authentication & Session Security**

#### **Current Implementation Analysis**
- **NextAuth.js**: Email/password and email link authentication
- **Session Strategy**: JWT-based sessions
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds

#### **Security Review Steps**
1. **Password Policy Assessment**
   - [ ] Minimum length requirements (currently 8 characters)
   - [ ] Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
   - [ ] Password history to prevent reuse
   - [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts

2. **Session Management**
   - [ ] JWT secret strength and rotation
   - [ ] Session timeout configuration
   - [ ] Secure cookie settings (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
   - [ ] Session invalidation on logout

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - [ ] Consider implementing 2FA/MFA
   - [ ] TOTP or SMS-based verification
   - [ ] Backup codes for account recovery

**Next Steps**: Implement this framework systematically, starting with the highest priority security areas based on current system architecture and threat landscape.
