## 🚀 **Updated Next Steps Guide - 2025-02-01**

### **🔥 CRITICAL: User Clarifications Required**

**Before proceeding with development, the following questions need answers:**

#### **1. Language Switcher Scope (Priority 1A)**
- **UI Only**: Should language switching only affect interface labels and navigation?
- **Document Generation**: Should invoices, orders, BOMs be generated in customer's preferred language?
- **Email Communication**: Should system emails (notifications, etc.) be localized?
- **Customer Language**: Should customers have a stored language preference for their documents?

#### **2. Credit Note Enhancement Strategy**
- **Partial Credit UI**: Should users select individual line items and quantities to credit?
- **Multiple Credits**: Should the system allow multiple partial credits per invoice?
- **Business Rules**: Any restrictions on partial credit amounts or timing?

#### **3. PDF Generation Architecture**
- **Background Jobs**: Should we implement Midday's async approach with Inngest for PDF generation?
- **File Storage**: Should generated PDFs be stored in cloud storage or served directly?
- **Template Priority**: Which document types need PDF generation first (invoices, orders, BOMs)?

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Notes**

### **Language Switcher Architecture**
- **i18n Framework**: Use `next-i18next` or React i18n
- **File Structure**: 
  ```
  public/locales/
    ├── fi/common.json
    ├── se/common.json
    └── en/common.json
  ```
- **Context Management**: Language preference stored in user session

### **Credit Note Enhancement**
- **Current Logic Issue**: Lines 484-485 in `invoice.actions.ts` negate ALL quantities
- **Required Change**: Add selective item/quantity mapping
- **UI Pattern**: Modal with table similar to invoice item selection

### **PDF Generation Strategy (Midday-Inspired)**
- **Background Processing**: Use existing Inngest setup for async generation
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time updates via tRPC subscriptions
- **Performance**: Store generated PDFs to avoid regeneration
- **Scalability**: Queue management for high-volume PDF generation

### **Excel Import Architecture**
- **Library**: Use `xlsx` library for Excel parsing
