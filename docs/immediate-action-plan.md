## 📊 **PRIORITIZATION RATIONALE**

### **Highest ROI Features Selected**
1. **Performance Indexes** (Impact: HIGH, Effort: 0.5h) = ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2. **BOM Detail Fix** (Impact: HIGH, Effort: 2h) = ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
3. **Conditional Vendor Fields** (Impact: MEDIUM, Effort: 2h) = ⭐⭐⭐⭐
4. **Order Type Pills** (Impact: MEDIUM, Effort: 2h) = ⭐⭐⭐⭐
5. **Customer Dropdown** (Impact: HIGH, Effort: 4h) = ⭐⭐⭐⭐

### **Strategic Dependencies Addressed**

## ⚠️ **RISKS & MITIGATION**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Form TypeScript Issues**: Schedule dedicated time for proper refactoring
- **PDF System Complexity**: Start with simple implementation, iterate
- **Real-time Features**: Consider WebSocket alternatives (polling)

### **Dependency Risks**
- **Replenishment Module**: Ensure inventory foundation completed first
- **Production Features**: BOM detail page fix is prerequisite
- **Advanced Features**: Don't start without proper foundation

### **Quality Risks**
- **No `@ts-nocheck` in new code**: All new features must be properly typed
- **Performance Regression**: Monitor after each major change
- **User Experience**: Test each enhancement with realistic data

---

## 📈 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Week 1 KPIs**
- ✅ 0 critical build errors
- ✅ 3 blockers resolved
- ✅ 60%+ performance improvement measured
- ✅ 6+ user-facing improvements delivered

### **Quality Gates**
- All TypeScript compilation clean
- Build performance under 30 seconds
- No new ESLint errors introduced
- User testing feedback positive

---

## 🚀 **EXECUTION GUIDELINES**

### **Development Workflow**
1. **Start with quickest wins** (performance indexes, small fixes)
2. **Test each change thoroughly** before moving to next
3. **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages
4. **Document each feature** as it's completed
5. **Run full build after each major change**

### **Quality Standards**
- **TypeScript strict mode**: No compromises on type safety
- **Component testing**: Verify UI changes in multiple scenarios  
- **Performance monitoring**: Check query times and page load speeds
- **User experience**: Test with realistic data and user flows

### **Communication**
- Update progress in daily standups
- Document blockers immediately
- Share wins and learnings
- Keep stakeholders informed of timeline changes
